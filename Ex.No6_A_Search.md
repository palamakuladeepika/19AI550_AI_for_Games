# Ex.No: 6  Implementation of Zombie survival game using A* search 
### DATE:                           
### Slot: 4H2-1
### Name: Palamakula Deepika
### REGISTER NUMBER : 212221240035
### AIM: 
To write a python program to simulate the Zomibie Survival game using A* Search 
### Algorithm:
1. Start the program
2. Import the necessary modules
3. Initiate the pygame engine and window
4. Collect the Zombie image and resize it within a display window 
5. Create a Euclidean distance heuristic function to find the distance from current location to Target position
6.  Move the Zombie towards the target by A* search 
7.  In main, create the obstacles and move the player by Key movements up, down,left and right 
10.  Update the display every time 
11.  Stop the program
